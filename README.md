# NAVA Analytics Dashboard

Welcome to your NAVA Analytics Dashboard, a powerful and visually appealing interface for tracking key metrics related to content generation. This dashboard is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, featuring interactive charts and a responsive design.

## Milestones & Todos

### Milestone 1: Initial UI & Responsiveness (Complete)
- [x] Set up the basic dashboard layout.
- [x] Created metric cards, charts, and activity heatmap using mock data.
- [x] Implemented a responsive header that adapts to different screen sizes.
- [x] Ensured a consistent and modern "glassmorphism" UI style, including refined transparency for overlays and drawers.
- [x] Adjusted component heights and spacing for a more polished and unified look.
- [x] Added custom branding with a new logo and favicon.
- [x] Integrated a togglable widget for Social Pulse and Generation Activity, allowing users to switch between views.
- [x] Developed the Social Pulse (SocialWeather) widget to display real-time social media insights.
- [x] Fine-tuned widget layouts and component positioning for improved visual consistency.

### Next Steps (Todos)
- [ ] **Backend & Authentication (High Priority)**:
    - [ ] Integrate a backend service (e.g., Supabase) to handle data and user authentication.
    - [ ] Replace `mockData.ts` and the mock adapter with live API calls.
    - [ ] Implement user login/logout functionality and secure the dashboard routes.
    - [ ] Connect real user data to the `UserNav` component.
- [ ] **Implement Data Filtering**:
    - [ ] Connect the "Filter data" dropdown and the date picker to the data-fetching logic.
    - [ ] Ensure all charts and metric cards update dynamically based on the selected filters.
- [ ] **Build Out Core Pages**:
    - [ ] Create and implement the "Profile", "Billing", and "Settings" pages accessible from the user menu.
    - [ ] Design a consistent and reusable layout for these secondary pages.
- [ ] **Refine State Management & Error Handling**:
    - [ ] Evaluate and potentially implement a global state manager (e.g., Zustand) for shared state like filters and user info.
    - [ ] Add robust loading states and user-friendly error messages for all asynchronous operations.
- [ ] **Testing**:
    - [ ] Write unit and integration tests for critical components (e.g., charts, data fetching hooks).
    - [ ] Ensure the application is reliable and maintainable.
