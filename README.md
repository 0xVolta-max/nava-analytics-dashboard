# NAVA Analytics Dashboard

Welcome to your NAVA Analytics Dashboard, a powerful and visually appealing interface for tracking key metrics related to content generation. This dashboard is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, featuring interactive charts and a responsive design.

## Milestones & Todos

### Milestone 1: Initial UI & Responsiveness (Complete)
- [x] Set up the basic dashboard layout.
- [x] Created metric cards, charts, and activity heatmap using mock data.
- [x] Implemented a responsive header that adapts to different screen sizes.
- [x] Ensured a consistent and modern "glassmorphism" UI style.

### Next Steps (Todos)
- [ ] **Implement Data Filtering**: Connect the "Filter data" dropdown and the date picker to actually filter the displayed metrics.
- [ ] **Backend Integration**: Replace the current `mockData.ts` with a real API connection to fetch live data.
- [ ] **Authentication**: Implement user authentication and connect it to the `UserNav` component.
- [ ] **Build Out Pages**: Create and implement the "Profile", "Billing", and "Settings" pages accessible from the user menu.
