# Status Update - Altcha Integration & Login Issues

This document summarizes the recent work done to fix the Altcha widget and the ongoing issues with the login functionality.

## Altcha Widget Status

**Goal**: Replace the non-functional custom Altcha widget with the official, interactive web component.

**Work Completed**:

1.  **Removed Custom Widget**: The old, non-interactive widget in `src/components/AltchaWidget.tsx` has been completely replaced.
2.  **Installed Official Library**: The official `altcha` library has been added to the project.
3.  **Implemented Web Component**: The new `AltchaWidget.tsx` now uses the official `<altcha-widget>` web component.
4.  **Added CSRF Protection**:
    *   A new API endpoint (`/api/csrf-token`) was created to generate and manage CSRF tokens.
    *   The Altcha widget is now configured to send the CSRF token with its verification requests, which should satisfy the security requirements of the backend.

**Current Status**:

*   The Altcha widget should now be interactive and correctly displayed on the Login and Sign Up pages.
*   The "Verification failed" error should be resolved.

## Login Functionality

**Issue**: Despite the fixes to the Altcha widget, the user reports that **login is still not possible**.

**Next Steps to Debug**:

To diagnose the login issue, we need to investigate the following:

1.  **Vercel Serverless Function Logs**:
    *   Check the runtime logs for the `/api/verify-altcha` endpoint on Vercel. Are there any errors when the widget is verified?
    *   Check the runtime logs for the Supabase `signIn` function call. Is Supabase returning any specific errors?
2.  **Browser Developer Console**:
    *   Open the browser's developer console (F12) on the login page.
    *   Look for any errors in the "Console" tab when you try to log in.
    *   Check the "Network" tab to see the requests being made to `/api/verify-altcha` and the Supabase API. What are the status codes and responses for these requests?

Please provide the logs and error messages from Vercel and the browser console so I can continue debugging the login issue.
