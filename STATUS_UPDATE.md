# Status Update - Authentication System & Captcha Integration

This document summarizes the recent work done to implement the authentication system with proper captcha integration and the current project status.

## Authentication System Implementation

**Goal**: Implement a complete authentication system with proper captcha integration for bot protection.

**Work Completed**:

### Captcha Integration
1.  **Transitioned to Turnstile**: Replaced Altcha with Cloudflare Turnstile for better reliability and user experience.
2.  **Implemented TurnstileWidget Component**: Created a new React component that properly integrates Cloudflare Turnstile.
3.  **Added Verification Logic**: Implemented proper token verification flow with the Cloudflare API.
4.  **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling for captcha verification failures.

### Authentication Context
1.  **AuthContext Implementation**: Created a centralized authentication context using React Context API.
2.  **State Management**: Proper user state management with loading states and error handling.
3.  **Session Persistence**: Implemented session persistence across browser sessions.
4.  **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with proper type definitions.

### UI/UX Improvements
1.  **Modern Login Interface**: Updated login form with better styling and user feedback.
2.  **Loading States**: Added loading indicators during authentication processes.
3.  **Error Messages**: Clear, user-friendly error messages for different failure scenarios.
4.  **Responsive Design**: Ensured proper display across different screen sizes.

**Current Status**:

*   Turnstile captcha is properly integrated and functional.
*   Authentication context provides centralized user management.
*   Login interface is modern and user-friendly.
*   All components are properly typed with TypeScript.
